2. Testable Behaviors

* Given a course, student, and courseGrade, addGrade should add a grade corresponding to the supplied course and student to the database
* addGrade should not return anything as it returns type void
* addGrade should permit adding multiple courseGrades for a student (assuming they are all for unique courses)
* addGrade should permit overriding a grade
* If null is supplied for the course, student, or courseGrade, addGrade should throw an exception
* If the supplied student has an id of null, addGrade should throw an exception
* If either of the supplied course names are empty string, addGrade should throw an exception
* If either of the supplied course names don't match the other, addGrade should throw an exception

3. Design Decisions
1. Throw exception if null is provided for any of the arguments
2. Allow overriding a grade rather than throwing an exception
