# CS4530 TDD Activity
This activity is intended to supplement the CS4530 lecture on test-driven development.

Steps:
1. Download and unpack the starter code (This is it!)
2. Write down the testable behaviors for the satisfaction condition: "Add a new grade for an existing student"
3. Identify at least two exceptional conditions or design decisions associated with these testable behaviors
4. Write Jest tests for your testable behaviors
5. Implement a method `addGrade` that passes your tests.
